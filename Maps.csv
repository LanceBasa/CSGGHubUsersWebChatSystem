Assault,"Counter-Terrorists must rescue hostages captured and put into a warehouse by a group of Terrorists. Despite being included in Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Source, both versions are noteworthy for their extreme differences. Counter-Strike: Source brought forth a very realistic approach, as well as excluding the Security cameras. Besides taking away the cameras, one of the major changes was the replacement of the highway with the train station. Some players got frustrated with the new changes, however, they are still present in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Even so, Assault is still one of the most popular maps in all Counter-Strike games. This map is considered to be unbalanced and gives an advantage to the Terrorist team as they can easily swarm around higher sections of the map, including the warehouse. In Source, this problem was somewhat nullified as the back entrance of the warehouse has an additional entry-point on the second floor. In Global Offensive, CTs can shoot Ts from the roof due to the windows, balancing the map more."
