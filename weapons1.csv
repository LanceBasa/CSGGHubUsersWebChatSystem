WEAPON,CATEGORY,DESCRIPTION,
Glock-18,Pistols,"The Glock-18 is one of the lowest-damage weapons in the game, but its 20-round magazine, plentiful reserve ammo, moderate rate of fire and three-shot burst fire option makes it one of the most versatile weapons for pistol rounds.",
P200,Pistols,"The default pistol for CTs, the P2000 has a lower fire rate and ammo count than the Glock-18 but makes up for it with its headshot kill potency against unarmored opponents in pistol rounds.",
USP-S,Pistols,"Added in a 2013 update, the USP-S is the alternative spawn pistol for CTs. It's slightly more accurate, does slightly more damage, and is much quieter than the P2000, but only has 24 rounds of reserve ammo.",
P250,Pistols,"The P250 is the cheapest weapon in CS:GO capable of dealing one-hit headshot kills to helmeted enemies, and it does more damage to armored enemies than the spawn pistols, but it only has two reserve ammo magazines.",
Dual Berettas,Pistols,"A flamboyant favorite of the Counter-Strike series, the Dual Berettas are capable of an incredible rate of fire and large ammo capacity, but they suffer from low damage and lengthy reload time.",
Tec-9,Pistols,"The Tec-9 straddles the line between pistols and submachine guns; it's lethal in close quarters and can be fired at high speed, but it suffers from less-than-ideal accuracy, recoil, and spread.",
Five-Seven,Pistols,"Headshot kill potential and a 20-round magazine are both defining features of the Five-SeveN. Its lethality drops off at range, however, and it isn't as accurate as other, cheaper pistols.",
CZ7.5-Auto,Pistols,"The CZ75-Auto is the only fully automatic pistol in CS:GO, and was added to the game in a 2014 update. It's a high-risk, high-reward weapon that excels in close range, but has only one spare magazine in reserve.",
Desert Eagle,Pistols,"The big daddy of all pistols, the ""Deagle"" packs a 50 caliber punch that can kill armored enemies with headshots from long range, but has a small magazine, lower fire rate, and high recoil and spread.",
Nova,Shotguns,"The Nova has the least spread of all shotguns in CS:GO and is devastating at close range, but has a rather low rate of fire and isn't very effective against armored opponents or opponents at longer ranges.",
XM1014,Shotguns,"The XM1014 has the highest rate of fire of all of the shotguns, and is a cheaper alternative to some rifles for close-range deadliness, but it does less damage than the Nova and is even less accurate at longer ranges.",
MAG-7,Shotguns,"The only shotgun to have a quick-reloading magazine, the MAG-7 is also more accurate than the Nova and XM1014, but has a slower rate of fire and lower magazine capacity.",
Sawed-Off,Shotguns,"The Sawed-off has the highest damage of all shotguns while costing the same as the Nova, but has significantly higher spread than the other shotguns and slows the player down the most while active.",
MAC-10,SMGs,"A cheap, lightweight, close-quarters lead-spitting machine, the MAC-10 has a very high rate of fire and does more damage than the MP9, but suffers from higher recoil and inaccuracy.",
MP9,SMGs,"The MP9 is very cheap, has a quick rate of fire and is one of the best weapons in CS:GO for rushing and spraying, but its low damage and high recoil limit its versatility.",
UMP-45,SMGs,"A large-caliber SMG for the masses, the UMP-45 has relatively high damage paired with good accuracy and a low price tag, but it has a lower rate of fire and smaller magazine size than most SMGs.",
MP7,SMGs,"The MP7 is a versatile, well-rounded weapon with a high fire rate and low recoil for an SMG, but its low damage and poor accuracy beyond close range hampers its further effectiveness.",
PP-Bizon,SMGs,"With a 64-round helical magazine and 120 spare rounds, as well as a speedy fire rate and reload time, the PP-Bizon is a spraying machine, but its damage and accuracy leave a lot to be desired.",
P90,SMGs,"The P90 has a ridiculously high fire rate, large magazine capacity, and somewhat good accuracy, but is by far the most expensive SMG and has pretty low damage per bullet.",
Galil AR,Rifles,"The rifle for the terrorist on a budget, the Galil AR lacks the headshot deadliness of the AK-47 or the SG 553, but has less recoil, a higher fire rate, and a relatively large magazine.",
FAMAS,Rifles,"The FAMAS is the cheapest, lowest-recoil CT rifle and has a three-round burst firing option that increases its accuracy and damage per second for longer range encounters, but has low damage and accuracy overall for a rifle.",
AK-47,Rifles,"Arguably the most popular weapon used in CS:GO, the AK-47 is beloved for its sniper-esque first-shot accuracy, one-hit headshot kill capability, and low price, but has poor full auto accuracy and a somewhat slow rate of fire.",
M4A4,Rifles,"The M4A4 is the main rival of the Terrorists' AK-47, having lower recoil and much higher accuracy but is unable to deal one-hit kills and is more expensive than its Terrorist counterpart.",
M4A1-S,Rifles,"Added in the 2013 update that also introduced the USP-S, the M4A1-s is an alternative to the M4A4 that features a quieter firing sound and slightly higher accuracy, but fires slower and has 10 less bullets per magazine.",
SG 553,Rifles,"The SG 553 is the scoped assault rifle alternative to the AK-47, dealing even higher damage per shot and ignoring armor on enemies, but has high recoil and slow movement speed while active.",
AUG,Rifles,"With a scope to increase long-range accuracy and lethality, the AUG has a high fire rate and relatively good accuracy, but is the most expensive rifle and deals lower damage compared to other rifles.",
SSG 08,Sniper Rifles,"The bolt-action SSG 08 is an extremely cheap and accurate weapon that can kill instantly with headshots and has a very low weight, but its rate of fire is very poor and it deals the lowest damage of all sniper rifles.",
AWP,Sniper Rifles,"Without a doubt the most infamous weapon of the Counter-Strike series, the AWP can kill armored opponents instantly above the legs and possesses high scoped accuracy, but it has a slow rate of fire, weighs a ton, and costs a fortune.",
G3SG1,Sniper Rifles,"The G3SG1 is the Terrorists' automatic sniper rifle that can deal substantial damage at range and fire relatively quickly, but is even more expensive than the AWP, slows down user movement speed dramatically, and takes ages to reload.",
SCAR-20,Sniper Rifles,"A defense-oriented weapon, the CT-exclusive SCAR-20 shares the high damage and fire rate of automatic sniper rifles, but isn't anywhere close to cheap to buy and slows the player's movement speed to a crawl.",
M249,Machine Guns,"The M249 is a bullet-spewing machine, having the second highest rate of fire of all weapons in the game, as well as a 100-round magazine and 200 rounds in reserve, but it has very high recoil and is both very heavy and expensive.",
Negev,Machine Guns,"The fire-rate king of all of the CS:GO weapons, the Negev boasts a massive 150-round drum and can rip enemies at close range to shreds, but has crippling recoil, an astronomical price tag, and a very heavy weight.",
Decoy Grenade,Grenades,"This cheap, flashbang look-alike, when thrown, emulates the firing sounds of the thrower's most powerful weapon, and shows the grenade's position as a player on the mini-map to both teams.",
Flashbang,Grenades,"The flashbang grenade is a potential game-changer, blinding nearby players that have it in sight when it explodes, and can deliver an element of surprise to almost any attack.",
HE Grenade,Grenades,"The definition of portable, throwable explosive weaponry, the HE grenade deals a good amount of damage within a fairly large radius, perfect for finishing off wounded enemies from a safe distance.",
Molotov,Grenades,"The smoke grenade, like the flashbang, is extremely beneficial in expert hands; it emits a thick cloud of gray smoke for an extended period of time, extinguishing firebombs and obstructing views for sneak attacks.",
Incendiary,Grenades,"The molotov isn't exactly a technological marvel, but it's extremely effective at covering a relatively large area with deadly flames that slow down opponents running through them.",
Smoke Grenade,Grenades,"The more expensive yet slightly more armor-damaging counterpart of the Terrorists' molotov, the incendiary grenade is equally capable when it comes to flame-spreading area denial.",
Knife,Other Equipment,,"Free with each spawn and unable to be dropped, the knife is a quiet, last-resort close-ranged weapon. It has a high-speed, low-damage primary attack and a low-speed, high-damage secondary attack, and can kill instantly with a backstab."
Zeus X27,Other Equipment,,"Essentially a slightly longer-ranged version of the knife, the Zeus is an instant kill on any part of the target's body, as long as they are within its very small range and the weapon's only shot hasn't been used yet."
